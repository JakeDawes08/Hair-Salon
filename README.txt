Miracle Massage & Spa by Jake Dawes
Design by @ajlkn | html5up.net

A big, modern, massage and spa website with a mobile-style menu, fully responsive styling,
and an assortment of pre-styled elements.

- It uses flexbox, which eliminates all kinds of terrible hacks and clunky layout
  stopgaps (like CSS grid systems).

- It uses Sass* a lot more intelligently, thanks in part to several new mixins
  and functions I've been working on (as well as a few by @HugoGiraudel).

- A ton of other stuff.
